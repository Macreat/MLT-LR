# vector projections

first sub task : create a Python script that demonstrates the projection of a 2D vector onto another 2D vector using both the analytical solution and the gradient descent method for the least squares problem. The script should include well-organized main methods for each approach, step-by-step explanations, and code comments. Visualize the results of both methods.

second sub task: create a Python code to demonstrate the projection of a 2D vector onto another. The code should include both an analytical solution and an iterative solution using gradient descent for the least squares problem. Organize the main methods clearly, describe the solution step-by-step, and include comments explaining the code. Additionally, visualize the evolution of the coefficient 'c' and the cost function during the gradient descent process.

third sub task: implement linear projection of two images (converted to vectors) using analytic solution and gradient descent in Python. Load two images, convert them to vectors, calculate the projection with both methods, convert the projection vector back to image, and view the results. Include comments in the code.
