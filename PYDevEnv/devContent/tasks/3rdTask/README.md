# Linear Regression and SGD Regression Analysis

This repository contains two complementary notebooks demonstrating the foundations of **Linear Regression** â€” both in its **analytical (closed-form)** and **iterative (gradient-based)** forms.  
The work uses standard datasets ( a ToySet and _California Housing_) to explore regression performance, diagnostics, and optimization dynamics.

## Goal and Data

Implements a **baseline linear regression** on a tabular dataset ( first on a 'toySet' and continuing with the `fetch_california_housing`).  
Performs a standard **train/test split**, evaluates the model with $$R^2$$, MSE, and MAPE,  
 and visualizes **residuals** (including a **QQ plot**, **L2 regularization**, **learning rate decay and early stopping**.) to assess each model validity.
